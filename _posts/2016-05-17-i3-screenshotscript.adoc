= i3 Screenshot Script with maim

I always need some "just in time" screenshot and I am annoyed, that the
wonderful i3 window manager does not support creating screenshots natively.
I wrote my own script for that, which I mapped to my `<print>` key.

[source, sh]
----
#!/bin/sh

SCREENDIR="/var/tmp/Screenshots"
SCREENFILE="${SCREENDIR}/Screenshot-$(date +'%F-%T').png"
LINKLATEST="${SCREENDIR}/latest"

[ ! -d "$SCREENDIR" ] && mkdir "$SCREENDIR"

sleep 0.5
maim -i $(xdotool getactivewindow) "$SCREENFILE"  # <1>
ln -sf "$SCREENFILE" "$LINKLATEST"  # <2>
----

<1> It takes the currently active window and creates a file with the current
    timestamp in `$SCREENDIR`; 
<2> it also adds a symlink `latest`, just in case you can't remember the current date. :)

The script is very simple and it could be heavily extendend, but I've been
using that gem for a while now and I think it is worth sharing. In i3,  
you can bind the script to your `<print>` key with this line in your
`~/.config/i3/config`:

----
bindsym Print exec screenshot.sh

Hint: You have to install the following programs; they should be available
in your Linux distribution of choice:
