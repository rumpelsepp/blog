= KDE Policykit Prompting to Increase Folder Watch Limit

As mentioned https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=180466#p1407397[here],
the solution is to cleanup kde-nepomuk entries in `/etc/sysctl.d`. These
entries are created on successful kauth authentication.  The obsolete nepomuk
entries overwrite the baloo entries.
