Hi, I'm Stefan. I like to mess with Linux, network security, and free
software. You may find me in the web as `rumpelsepp`, or on:

* Matrix: @rumpelsepp:hackbrettl.de,
* [Github](https://github.com/rumpelsepp), or
* [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@rumpelsepp).

You might also find me as `Steff` who is playing the guitar on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwEd6ddfgsjP_naRbS1q9JA) or in my [band](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_f3A1kUkOkQzo7GXy6x-Hg).

Over the years I experimented a lot with mail servers and DNS, so there are a few email addresses lurking around in the internet:

* stefan.tatschner@gmail.com
* stefan@sevenbyte.org
* stefan.tatschner@mailbox.org (<- used for everything „serious“)
* stefan@rumpelsepp.org (<- everything else; open source stuff)

Everything is collected in a single mailbox, so it doesn't matter that much which one you choose.

## GPG Key

I hate PGP, thus I prefer to not use it.
Just contact me via matrix and enable E2EE.
